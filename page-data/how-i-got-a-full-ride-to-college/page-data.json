I was intrigued because the headline said, “Scholarship for undocumented students”. I immediately clicked on it that link took me to their website, where I spent a few minutes reading the scholarship requirements.</p>\n<p>Long-story-short I started the application that day, but I thought it was too good to be true because, during that time, racism was fueled by president trump. I ended up leaving the application halfway done fast forward a few days later. I saw a tweet from thedream.us saying that it was the last day to submit the application, it was hours before the deadline, but I had to submit it because I used to work the second shift, and I knew I wouldn’t get home till midnight. So I decided to finish it and hope for the best; I wasn’t confident because I am not smart at all. I graduated high school with a 3.0 GPA and then went to community college to graduate with a 3.5 GPA. In my mind, I was like scholarships only go to recent high school graduates or really smart people (which I am neither of those two), plus I am an old soul (I was 24 at that time). Also, I wondered why a person or organization would offer an undocumented student a full ride to college?. Yeah, this is too good to be true, but I ended up submitting the application like what the hell do I got to lose? Nothing.</p>\n<p>Anyhow, I clicked the submit button minutes before leaving to go work in a job where I was not happy at all, and most of the time, I felt depressed. Three months later, and quite honestly, I forced myself to forget about the application because I knew I wasn’t going to get the scholarship. So one day before the whole country shut down, I was on the treadmill at the gym when a notification from google Gmail popped out. This was the email I got:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://google.com.au/\"><span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; max-width: 630px; \">\n      <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 69.62025316455697%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n  <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" alt=\"scholarship\" title=\"scholarship\" src=\"/static/64cbcaeb9ec9a05c8ce2168bbf2185fe/f058b/scholarship.png\" srcset=\"/static/64cbcaeb9ec9a05c8ce2168bbf2185fe/c26ae/scholarship.png 158w,\n/static/64cbcaeb9ec9a05c8ce2168bbf2185fe/6bdcf/scholarship.png 315w,\n/static/64cbcaeb9ec9a05c8ce2168bbf2185fe/f058b/scholarship.png 630w,\n/static/64cbcaeb9ec9a05c8ce2168bbf2185fe/40601/scholarship.png 945w,\n/static/64cbcaeb9ec9a05c8ce2168bbf2185fe/78612/scholarship.png 1260w,\n/static/64cbcaeb9ec9a05c8ce2168bbf2185fe/1d97b/scholarship.png 1993w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\" loading=\"lazy\">\n    </span></a></p>\n<p>When I tell you that, I immediately left the gym and headed home while one or two tears started dripping from my eyes. I cannot believe it for the first time something good happened to me in my life. I was awarded a full ride to college; never in my life would I see myself going to a four-year college mainly because I am an undocumented student, meaning that I cannot receive any financial aid. Colleges in America are too expensive. I know that first hand. After all, I struggled a lot when I went to community college because I worked a lot to make the monthly payments for the tuition barely. So, I don’t want to keep making this post longer than it should. I want to say that I am and will forever be grateful to <a href=\"http://thedream.us\">thedream.us</a> for giving me a chance to better my life and making me the first person in my family ever to attend college. I hope one day I can make a difference in someone’s life.I am a proud Dreamer and a proud college student from <strong>Delaware State University.</strong></p>\n<h6>I apologize for any grammatical mistakes. I am not a good writer. I promise that I will try to better myself.</h6>","frontmatter":{"title":"How I got a full ride to college","date":"February 05, 2021","description":"I still cannot believe that I got a full ride to college"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/hello-mundo/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Hello Mundo"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/college-life/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How is my college life"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"c6c4fcb8-f378-5c46-b654-d5c6ee6cca9d","previousPostId":"ecdd8e3f-f0a6-5d66-9e43-876f6d9f180a","nextPostId":"2bb7227b-0c61-5ae3-bdd8-c63fa77c47e2"}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
