Not me, that is for sure, as my friend was driving me to campus, which is located in Dover, Delaware, which is also an 11-hour drive. I was thinking to myself what is awaiting me, unsure of that answer, I closed my eyes and woke up right before arriving on campus. It finally hit me I am a college student now; unfortunately, my first semester of college was happening while we were in the middle of a pandemic. All of my classes were online (which sucks), but I was happy. Nonetheless, I moved into my dorm, and my college life began.</p>\n<p>I sat there for a minute to contemplate my life and how far I have come, but my imposter syndrome decided to make an appearance, so that killed my good mood. I have met some good people on campus but because of covid-19, meeting new people was risky and limited. Anyhow, my dorm was off-campus, and since I did not have a car going to get food to the dining hall was an adventure since I either had to walk or take the shuttle or ride with a friend. The food on campus was not too bad. I did get sick from it real quick, so most of the time, I was eating a protein shake or a rice cake with peanut butter. Something good from that was that I lost some weight, which is always good since I am overweight.</p>\n<p>My first semester went well despite the pandemic, and it came to an end two weeks before Thanksgiving because that is when I moved back home. At the end of the semester, my grades were A’s in all of my six courses, which made me feel proud of myself. Here I am in week three of my second semester of college. My goal for this semester is to have all A’s again and finally learn to program. I have created this blog to hold myself accountable for documenting my journey to learning to program and in my college career.I will try my best to become a better writer because I want to tell my story and stories from people who are experiencing the same journey as me.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How is my college life","date":"February 05, 2021","description":"I still cannot believe I am a college student"}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/how-i-got-a-full-ride-to-college/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I got a full ride to college"}},"next":null},"pageContext":{"id":"2bb7227b-0c61-5ae3-bdd8-c63fa77c47e2","previousPostId":"c6c4fcb8-f378-5c46-b654-d5c6ee6cca9d","nextPostId":null}},"staticQueryHashes":["2841359383","916993862"]}
